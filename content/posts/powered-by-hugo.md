I am not a front end developer...

14 years in IT, I regret not learning more html/css/js.  That negligence has brought me to this point.

There's a big difference between working with html files hosted in a load balanced IIS cluster versus building a site from scratch, tweaking it, making it look good, etc.

Before Hugo I tried:
- Rolling my own with html 5 and css 3 - Way harder than it sounds [fail]
- Gatsby.JS - Kinda need to know how to use Node.js, React, and GraphQL effectively which I don't [fail]
- Pelican - Like the concept but the workflow was too destructive for me [fail]
- MkDocs - Useful for documentation sites, not useful for blogging [fail]
- Jekyll - Didn't want to go down the Ruby rabbit hole just yet [fail]

I really wanted to make it work with Pelican and MkDocs since they're powered by Python which is a very powerful language.  But when your bottleneck is preventing you from moving forward, it's just time to move on.  Why Python?  Because DevOps of course :)

### Yay for Hugo!

Seriously, with Hugo I'm able to get a format and workflow that I really enjoy.  Having this boring simplicity is ideal for me because there's already so much in my full-stack brain that if I tried to cram in too much front end stuff I might go crazy.

I'm going to keep this blog as simple as possible.  No ads, no disqus, no commenting, no bullshit.

Shout out to [zwbetz](https://zwbetz.com/make-a-hugo-blog-from-scratch/) for providing a very easy to follow guide on getting up and running with Hugo quickly.  Cheers!
