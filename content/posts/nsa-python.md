In 1997 I recall my VB6 college professor [Mr. Shroff](https://www.absolutedental.com/doctor/sulabh-shroff/) asked us to name a programming language.  At the time I was studying for my AA in Electronic Engineering but I was also working at CompUSA which is probably the best job I ever had.  It was the catalyst for me into IT.  Anyway, Mr. Shroff looks at me, asks me to name a language, and after a brief moment I remember chatting with Brandon at the upgrades counter at work and his new jump on Python.  'Great language, very powerful' he exclaims and my dumbass should've picked up on that.  But hey VB6 wasn't all that bad right?  Alas, here we are.

If you haven't seen it yet, thanks to a FOIA submitted by [@chris_swenson](https://twitter.com/chris_swenson/status/1225836060938125313), the NSA has unclassified it's COMP3321 course on Python.  Thanks Chris!

The ocr'd pdf is 395 pages of 30+ lessons or sections.  The material is designed to be covered in a 2 week period if the user allots themselves about an hour per lesson.  Barring any interruptions, I hope to complete it by the end of February with week 1 starting today.

This post should be read in the context of me just chatting with someone at the bar about the course and not actually teaching about Python or programming.  However, if you're new to programming and have somehow fumbled your way into my cozy little spot here then please listen to me when I say, learn Python!  Trust me, it will open many doors for you.

Moving on!
